## description

This application allows a user to view the current tempature, wind speed, and humidity along with a future 5 day forecast of the same conditions 

I liked the results of the application and that they are very helpful to the user when needed 

this challange was very difficult for me. I had several difficult times with the API.

Java script has been a real challange for me to understand. completeing this challange has added to my confidence in the skills I have learned.
